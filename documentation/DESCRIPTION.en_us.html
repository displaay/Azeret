	<h1>Azeret</h1>
	<p>The story of the typeface began with a draft that was driven by an exploration of OCR fonts, past and futuristic operating systems, various interfaces and the nineties. The final result is more based on a desire to achieve an appearance of the typeface that could serve in operating systems. Thus the overall character is a conjunction of everything described with details that evoke a specific personality.</p>

	<p>Azeret is a sans-serif typeface with a mono-linear character. Don't go looking for too much contrast in the strokes! The circular parts of the letters do not have a smooth connection to the stems. The x-height is higher than usual and thus the ascenders and descenders are short. Alternates are also available which open the possibility of creating different moods. A number of them hint at a nineties aesthetic.</p>

	<p>The monospaced sub-family is available for free and is also on GoogleFonts. If you would like to explore Azeret more you can do it on our micro-site which we developed with Martin Ehrlich.</p>
